  <center><h1>UI UX Designer</h1></center> 
  <br><br>
  <p>UI (user interface) design is all about what users actually see on the applicationâ€™s screen â€“ text, colors, backgrounds, icons, and moving elements like animations. Thatâ€™s why UI design overlaps with graphic design. The career path in UI design is quite similar to graphic design â€“ graphic design education and experience in product development projects are a big plus for UI designers.</p>

   <p> UX (user experience) design focuses on studying how users move through all the different elements of the UI. For UX designers, itâ€™s all about the flow of the user experience and eliminating any sources of friction during these interactions. Thatâ€™s why UX designers need to know the methods and tools for studying user behaviors â€“ and then translate their insights into design guidelines or principles. A UX designer is responsible for making products usable, enjoyable, and accessible to users.</p> 
    
    <p>While UI handles the look of a digital product, UX handles how all of the UI elements work together to create a seamless user experience.</p>  
    
    <p>A UX/UI designer combines these two areas by carrying out user research first, and then implementing the findings in the visual design in the form of mockups, wireframes, and prototypes. These are then tested, and user feedback is gathered to inform further changes and bring the product to the greatest possible shape before the launch. The daily responsibilities of a UX/UI designer depend on the kinds of projects they work on, the company, team size, and priorities. While some designers focus on tangible products such as mobile apps or VR devices, others design the overall experience of staying at a hotel or using public transportation. </p>

    <p>Your everyday tasks as a UX/UI designer depend on your exact role and the type of company you work for. The tasks range from more conceptual ones like research, testing, and business analysis, to more hands-on ones like wireframing and prototyping. </p>
    
    <p>However, there are a few general functions that a UX/UI designer can be expected to perform. Hereâ€™s a short list of the typical things designers do at their jobs.</p>
    
     
    
    <h3>a) Carrying out user research</h3>
    <p>The initial phase in the UX design process is research. It can take different forms â€“ from desk-based to field research. The goal is to get a full picture of the target audience for whom the product or service is intended.</p>
    <p>>The user research phase helps teams to scope out the project, identify exactly who theyâ€™re designing for, and what the key user goals and challenges are in relation to the product. </p>
    
     
    
    <h3>b) Building user personas </h3>
    <p>Based on the user research, UX/UI designers create user personas that explore in more depth the particular tasks every persona wants to perform and why. A typical persona includes demographic data, as well as information about preferences, habits, likes, and dislikes, and connection to trends.</p>
    
    <p>Another popular approach that can be used together with (or instead of) user personas is Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD). JTBD shifts the focus from the hypothetical user to what the actual users are looking to accomplish by using a product.</p> 
    
     
    
    <h3>c) Crafting the information architecture</h3>
    <p>Next, designers usually start thinking about the kind of content they need to display in products or marketing materials. This is where they consider how all of the key information will be structured across the website or application. This is called information architecture â€“ and crafting it is the task of working out the most logical content layout and organization. </p>
    
   <p> Why is information architecture important? A good one ensures that the user can easily navigate the product/site, find what theyâ€™re looking for, and accomplish their goals quickly.</p>
